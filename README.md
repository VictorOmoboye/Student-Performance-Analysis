### PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Aspire Education Hub** faces the challenge of understanding the complex factors influencing student performance, which include demographic, academic, and extracurricular variables. The institution seeks to identify the most predictive factors of academic success, uncover patterns and relationships between these variables, and develop a predictive model to classify students into grade categories. This will enable timely, targeted interventions and equitable support for students, addressing their diverse needs and enhancing overall learning outcomes.

### AIM OF THE PROJECT
- Identify academic and non-academic factors that are most predictive of student success.
- Uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among demographic, academic, and extracurricular variables.
- Develop a predictive model to classify students into grade categories for timely and targeted interventions.
- Provide actionable insights to support diverse student needs effectively and equitably.
- Foster a data-driven approach to improving academic outcomes and student support strategies.

### METHODOLOGY
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle any missing values. Check for and correct anomalies.
- **Data Exploration:** Conduct basic statistical analysis to understand the distribution of each variable. Also Identify outliers, patterns, and trends in the data.
- **Univariate Analysis:** Examine the distribution and spread of key variables, such as study time, parental education level, and GPA. Also Explore how frequently students participate in activities like sports, music, and volunteering.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Analyze relationships between pairs of variables, for instance, the correlation between GPA and study time or absences. Investigate gender or ethnicity differences in academic performance.
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Examine interactions between multiple factors to identify complex relationships, such as how extracurricular activities and parental support jointly affect student performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize a variety of visualizations to effectively communicate
findings and trends
