### PROBLEM STATEMENT
**Aspire Education Hub** faces the challenge of understanding the complex factors influencing student performance, which include demographic, academic, and extracurricular variables. The institution seeks to identify the most predictive factors of academic success, uncover patterns and relationships between these variables, and develop a predictive model to classify students into grade categories. This will enable timely, targeted interventions and equitable support for students, addressing their diverse needs and enhancing overall learning outcomes.

### AIM OF THE PROJECT
- Identify academic and non-academic factors that are most predictive of student success.
- Uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among demographic, academic, and extracurricular variables.
- Develop a predictive model to classify students into grade categories for timely and targeted interventions.
- Provide actionable insights to support diverse student needs effectively and equitably.
- Foster a data-driven approach to improving academic outcomes and student support strategies.

### METHODOLOGY
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle any missing values. Check for and correct anomalies.
- **Data Exploration:** Conduct basic statistical analysis to understand the distribution of each variable. Also Identify outliers, patterns, and trends in the data.
- **Univariate Analysis:** Examine the distribution and spread of key variables, such as study time, parental education level, and GPA. Also Explore how frequently students participate in activities like sports, music, and volunteering.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Analyze relationships between pairs of variables, for instance, the correlation between GPA and study time or absences. Investigate gender or ethnicity differences in academic performance.
- **Multivariate Analysis:** Examine interactions between multiple factors to identify complex relationships, such as how extracurricular activities and parental support jointly affect student performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize a variety of visualizations to effectively communicate
findings and trends

### EXPECTED OUTCOME
- **Improved Understanding:** Deeper insights into factors affecting student performance.
- **Proactive Interventions:** Data-driven strategies to support underperforming students.
- **Enhanced Equity:** Tailored solutions to address diverse student needs, ensuring fair academic support for all.

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
#### Data Cleaning
After importing the necessary libraries, this code identifies and visualizes missing values in key columns, including Parental Education, Weekly Study Time, Absences, and Parental Support.

The code addresses missing values by employing appropriate imputation techniques, such as replacing them with the mean, median, or mode, depending on the nature of the data and its distribution. Additionally, it removes irrelevant or redundant columns/features to streamline the dataset, ensuring optimal relevance and efficiency for subsequent analysis.

#### Data Exploration
The code performs data quality checks by identifying and removing 207 duplicate entries to enhance dataset accuracy. It conducts basic statistical analysis, generating summaries to understand the distribution of each variable. Additionally, the code identifies patterns, trends, and outliers within the data, revealing anomalies in certain columns, such as Age, which contains notable outliers. This ensures a deeper understanding of the dataset and highlights areas requiring further attention.

#### Univariate Analysis
The code analyzes and visualizes variable distributions using bar plots and box plots to examine individual variables such as *GPA*, *Extracurricular Participation*, *Age*, and *Study Time*. These visualizations provide insights into the spread and frequency of the data, highlighting features like *Age* and *Study Time* that exhibit significant outliers. This step facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics and informs subsequent analyses.

The code addresses outliers by calculating the Interquartile Range (IQR) for the affected columns and applying appropriate techniques, such as capping or removal, to ensure the data remains robust and free from extreme anomalies. This step enhances the dataset's reliability for analysis and modeling.
